## ü§ñ AI Models & APIs Used

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
- **Meta LLaMA 4 Scout**: `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
  - Used for multimodal image analysis and medical consultation
  - Provides professional medical insights and recommendations

### Speech Recognition
- **OpenAI Whisper Large V3**: `whisper-large-v3`
  - High-accuracy speech-to-text transcription
  - Processes patient voice queries

### Text-to-Speech Services
- **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**: Natural voice synthesis
- **ElevenLabs**: Premium AI voice generation with realistic speech patterns

### API Providers
- **GROQ**: High-performance inference for LLaMA models and Whisper
- **ElevenLabs**: Advanced text-to-speech API

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg (for audio processing)
- PortAudio (for microphone access)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-doctor.git
   cd ai-doctor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install system dependencies**
   
   **For Windows:**
   ```bash
   # Install FFmpeg and add to PATH
   ```
   
   **For macOS:**
   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg portaudio
   ```
   
   **For Ubuntu/Debian:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ffmpeg portaudio19-dev
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
   ```

### Required Python Packages

```txt
gradio
groq
python-dotenv
gtts
elevenlabs
speech-recognition
pydub
pillow
base64
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   python gradio_app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:7860/`

3. **Using the AI Doctor**
   - **Record Audio**: Click the microphone button and describe your medical concern
   - **Upload Image**: Upload a medical image (skin condition, X-ray, etc.)
   - **Get Diagnosis**: The AI will analyze both inputs and provide medical insights
   - **Listen to Response**: The diagnosis will be read aloud using AI voice synthesis

## üîß Core Components

### 1. Brain of the Doctor (`brain_of_the_doctor.py`)
- **Image Encoding**: Converts images to base64 format for API processing
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Uses LLaMA 4 Scout for combined text and image understanding
- **Medical Reasoning**: Provides differential diagnoses and treatment suggestions

### 2. Voice of the Patient (`voice_of_the_patient.py`)
- **Audio Recording**: Captures microphone input with ambient noise adjustment
- **Speech Transcription**: Converts audio to text using Whisper Large V3
- **Audio Processing**: Handles MP3 conversion and file management

### 3. Voice of the Doctor (`voice_of_the_doctor.py`)
- **Text-to-Speech Options**: 
  - gTTS for basic voice synthesis
  - ElevenLabs for premium, natural-sounding speech
- **Cross-Platform Audio**: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux playback
- **Audio Format Conversion**: MP3 to WAV conversion for compatibility

### 4. Gradio Interface (`gradio_app.py`)
- **User Interface**: Clean, intuitive web interface
- **Input Handling**: Processes both audio and image inputs simultaneously
- **Response Display**: Shows transcription, diagnosis, and plays audio response

## üéØ System Prompt & Behavior

The AI doctor is configured with a specialized system prompt that:
- Acts as a professional medical consultant
- Provides concise, direct medical advice
- Focuses on differential diagnoses and remedies
- Maintains a professional, empathetic tone
- Avoids AI-like responses and formatting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

- **Educational Purpose Only**: This application is designed for learning and demonstration purposes
- **Not a Replacement for Medical Care**: Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical concerns
- **No Medical Liability**: The AI's responses should not be considered professional medical advice

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: Audio recording and processing happen locally
- **API Security**: Uses secure API keys for external services
- **No Data Storage**: Patient data is not permanently stored

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Changing AI Models
- Modify the `model` variable in `brain_of_the_doctor.py`
- Update the `stt_model` in `voice_of_the_patient.py`

### Voice Customization
- Change the `voice_id` in `voice_of_the_doctor.py` for different ElevenLabs voices
- Adjust language settings in gTTS configuration

### System Prompt Modification
- Edit the `system_prompt` variable in `gradio_app.py` to change AI behavior

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Microphone Not Working**
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Ensure PortAudio is properly installed

2. **API Errors**
   - Verify API keys in `.env` file
   - Check API quotas and limits

3. **Audio Playback Issues**
